    "Duplicates",

We observed this for address fields, date of birth and other personal details, but did not observe it for procedure data.",
    "In order to avoid true duplicates occurring in the data, we have included distinct records for  NHSNumber (person_id) , PrimaryProcedureOpcs(procedure_concept_id), ProcedureOpcs(procedure_concept_id), ProcedureDate (procedure_date) and excluded all duplicates.  The tool will handle things a little differently, as each new submission will have to be dealt with as it arrives.")]
