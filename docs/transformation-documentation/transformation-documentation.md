# Transformation Documentation

This section of the site covers the documentation for the mappings completed so far from various sources to OMOP v5.4.

The page is structured based on the OMOP tables mapped. Underneath each table page you will find:

* A contents list for the fields mapped
* A summary diagram showing the high level field mappings at table level from the various sources, with one graph for each data source
* A button to submit a comment or raise an issue for the table level mapping
* When clicking through to the field level mappings you will find:
    * Detail of the source column
    * Any appropriate documentation notes
    * Any appropriate SQL code
    * A button to submit a comment or raise an issue for the field level mapping

We encourage you to use the buttons to comment on or raise an issue with the mappings, to help us to continue to improve them.
